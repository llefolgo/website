# Biography

I am currently a visiting postdoctoral fellow at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), thanks to the [MSR-Inria Joint Centre](www.msr-inria.fr). I am a member of the [InnerEye](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/medical-image-analysis/) team, a research project focused on quantitative medical image analysis.

I am interested in data analysis, including machine learning, signal processing and information geometry -- anything that involves algorithms to automatically understand & leverage structure in complex data. 

I'm always keen to hear about other fields of applied maths: computational biology, language processing, physics...
