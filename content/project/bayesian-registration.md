title = "Bayesian Medical Image Registration"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Non-rigid registration schemes supplement incomplete observations (image data) with prior assumptions (e.g. plausible object deformations, image generation). They operate under data noise, model biases and uncertainties. The ability to quantify those uncertainties and to analyze the soundness of model assumptions is very appealing, especially if registration is part of a larger pipeline. The project aims at a fully Bayesian treatment of registration, as a natural framework to address these questions."

Here is a [link](https://oops/bayesian-registration.pptx) to my slides on this project, where you will find videos, results & a high-level walkthrough. All of the technical details can be found in these two publications [here](../../publication/sbr-fast-registration) and [there](../../publication/sbr-uq).

The project was started while a Ph.D. candidate at Inria [Asclepios](https://team.inria.fr/asclepios/), under the supervision of Herv√© Delingette and Nicholas Ayache.
